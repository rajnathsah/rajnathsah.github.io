# Scrape linkedin.com post using Python

Linkedin is for professional networking. it is also used by employers for posting jobs. There are cases where recruiters post job on there page which can be searched as content. When i was searching job, i found many jobs were posted by recruiter as post. To search such job, one has to search content. I tried to automate the same by scraping the content using python, selenium and beautifulsoup.

Download the code from [github](https://github.com/rajnathsah/LinkedinJobScraping) repo. Install dependecies and run ScrapeLinkedin.py file from command prompt or terminal. It will automatically download latest chrome web driver and place it in current working directory and use it for scraping content. Feel free to download the code and try, let me know if there is any suggestion and feedback.

For more details about the code, please refer github repo.  

Happy learning and job hunting!
