# Python

Thinking of learning Python or planing to change career track to be Python developer.  

Let us start with few job profile where Python developers are in demand: *Python Developer, Data Analyst, Automation Engineer, Full Stack Python Developer, Backend Engineer, Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer*  

All right! then let us start the journey of learning Python.  

# Basic Python Learning Plan
  1.  Introduction to Python
     *    Python installation and setup  
    *    Basic syntax and data types  
    *  Variables and operators  
    *  Links  
        *  https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/
        *  ttps://www.w3schools.com/python/


# Learning Materials  

*  [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
*  [tkinter](https://www.python-course.eu/python_tkinter.php)
*  [Flask](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)
*  [Corey Schafer YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5)
*  [How Python Runs](https://indianpythonista.wordpress.com/2018/01/04/how-python-runs/)

# Books for reference and concept
Go through the books listed [here](https://realpython.com/best-python-books/#python-cookbook) and based on your level of understanding, take any book and start reading it. In case you did not understand any topic or example of the book, don't stop and spend too much time on it. You can always come back later and go through again.  

# Try online programming challege
Login to [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/) and try some programming challege whenever you get sometime. It helps in mastering algorithm and python skill.  

# Learn Python by building some useful projects  

*  Build small window application using tkinter. Think of any problem which you want to solve, if you are not able to find then take any existing product where desktop application is used and develop application for it. This application should have login functionality, it should have main window with menus. To start with, you can use [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database. You can refer [Python Sqlite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pd-0G0MigUA) video to start with.
You can refer tkinter [demo](https://github.com/rajnathsah/tkinterwindowapp).
*  Write script to scrape data from any website. You can refer [Beautiful-Soup web scraper](https://realpython.com/beautiful-soup-web-scraper-python/)
*  Develop portfolio website with CRUD and REST API functionality. You can start with Flask framework.
