In this version, downloading chromedriver and config file creation is automated. It downloads latest chrome driver, generate config file and copy resume in current folder. On sub-sequent execution, it runs as usual and re-download chrome driver after 7 days. In case there is any update in configuration values, delete old config file and run the program again, it will prompt for config file generation. Password in config file are encrypted.
