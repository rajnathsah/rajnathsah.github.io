# Automate resume upload

Updating profile daily makes it easier for recruiter to notice profile. Using one click resume upload, job search can be made easy by keeping profile updated on [naukri.com](www.naukri.com), [naukrigulf.com](www.naukrigulf.com) and [MonsterIndia.com](www.monsterindia.com).

It is easy to configure and run. It can also be scheduled to run on personal computer.

Feel free to dowload the source code and executable from [github](https://github.com/rajnathsah/AutoResumeUpload) and try it. In case of any issue, help or suggestions, you can always reach me through discussion thread, social media or email.


Happy job hunting.
